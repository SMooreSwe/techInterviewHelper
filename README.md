# Technical Interview Helper

This project was built in a day, as part of a Hack-Day event. It uses React Native and Typescript. The backend is in a separate repository and is running using MongoDB. Quotes are generated with the Techy API.

The project includes a working system for account creation, user login and saving data to user profiles.

## Areas for Improvement

Given the time-limit, there are areas that I would like to improve upon. These are:

 - Token Authentication for users.
 - Protecting the user page route and preventing use of the History Object to access it, once it is left.
- Error handling, in the event of a backend disconnect.
- Responsive CSS.


## Usage

This Project is more proof-of-concept and for entertainment only. It is not a "useful" product, albeit the application of the code has been a great learning experience. Please don't use it for actual interviews!
